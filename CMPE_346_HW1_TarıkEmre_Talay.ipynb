       "\"Purchased device worked advertised never much phone memory since download lot stuff brainer. Works expected sprung higher capacity think made bit cheesier earlier versions paint looks clean. I think worked great had different brand gb card went south months this one held pretty well since note. months zero issues since transferred note note card reliable solidcheers. Bought retail packaging arrived legit orange envelope English version Asian like picture shows arrived quickly bought retail packaging, htc one sv lg optimus cards working order probably best price get nice sd card. Mini storage anything else supposed purchased, add additional storage microsoft surface pro tablet come gb. Supposed Sandisk's long standing reputation speaks. Phone never skips beat file transfers, speedy corruption issues, memory fade issues would expect Sandisk brand great card entrust precious files slightly cheaper piece crap lose everything for spending extra couple bucks trusted product goes good data. Hard believe affordable digital become gb device one quarter size postage stamp would science fiction less generation ago, picked portable music want school risk phone id works great sd card readers select confidence. Works that rezound running short space go sandisk ordered came fast issues. Galaxy super fast card totally happy happy still type fill required words though. Like sd card take music video downloads, personal videos, files,docs multimedia images, fast transfer rate class speed take games large files easily still enough space apps, great video cameras, camcorders supplied adapter fits easily smartphones, tablets, sd card slots recommend sd card everyone. Works file writes bit slower expected usb readeralso reads writes faster card inside standardized sd adapter mbs vs write Mbs vs mbs read card reader cannot figure. Name speaks go sandisk go. Solid HD card fast reading, writing fast recording video pics, great capacity, reasonably priced issues it overall highly recommend. heard cards write speed insufficient, however, used extensively single problem. Bought use go pro hero black edition requires class microSD card far issues fast readwrite came adapter small packaging needed comes nice hard plastic case keep dry together needed. Got gig one filled kept getting insufficient disk space, phone kids take phone selfies, mostly daughter. Get bigger card, get one carry old phoneneedless say sweet plenty, space delete pictures anymore, well at least my daughter loves selfies. Class speed rating seamless full HD video. The skylight at the top of the arc runs almost the length of the room. In the course of his reconstitution of the urban administration he created new offices in connection with the public works, streets, and aqueducts of Rome. Read write speeds better Samsung sd card previously would hesitate buy another one great micro sd cards, sandisk also clip plus mp player works well think becoming fan sandisk products. Works all video stuttering like gb, blah, blah blah, fill rest. Works expected high transfer speed nice extra microsd adapters lying around since always seem misplace mainly bought use nikon dslr since put card directly cm modded nook and tablet field view images larger screen. Works great Samsung Galaxy formatted straight away full size cannot really tell speed difference, one slower card replaced guess if phone cannot take advantage. Aaron maddensandisk never disappoints always sandisk products worth every penny nice product quality works great recommend product everyone. Aaron mckaigood price works flawless Samsung normal sandisk quality go brand brand brand. Aaron Nashsan disk hard beat pay brand get quality product would purchase.
